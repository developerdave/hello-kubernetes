Example Kubernetes, Jib and SpringBoot deployment. Uses minikube to keep the deployment as
simple as possible.

When up and running run `minikube service web-service --url` to see the exposed service url and then hit
the returned url with `/greeting` on the end. For example `http://192.168.99.100:30001/greeting`
